# Project in React APP for learning - Address Search Project - Projeto em React APP para aprendizado - Projeto de Busca de Endereço

## Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
No diretório do projeto, você pode executar:
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.: \ Execute o aplicativo no modo de desenvolvimento.:
[http://localhost:3000]

The page will reload when you make changes.\ A página será recarregada quando você fizer alterações.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console. \ Você também pode ver erros de lint no console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
Inicia o executor de teste no modo de observação interativo.\
Consulte a seção sobre [execução de testes](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) para obter mais informações.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\ Crie o aplicativo para produção na pasta `build`.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. \ Ele empacota corretamente o React no modo de produção e otimiza a compilação para obter o melhor desempenho.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\ A compilação é minificada e os nomes dos arquivos incluem os hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!  Seu aplicativo está pronto para ser implantado!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.\
Consulte a seção sobre [implantação](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) para obter mais informações.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
